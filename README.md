  - Code: https://github.com/SH00git/NLP/blob/main/P10.0%20SMS%20Spam%20Analysis.ipynb

  - Steps followed:
    - Libraries used: pandas, numpy, spacy, Scikit Learn,seaborn, matplotlib
    - Preprocessing:  Lowercasing, Stop Word and Punctuation Removal, Tokenisation, Lemmetization, Vectorization (Bag of Words and bi-grams).
    - Visualisation: Histogram plot of token length and charcter length for spam- ham messages.
    - Modelling : NaivesBayes Model tuned with GridSearchCV
    - Results: Classification Report, accuracy_score and Confusion Matrix
    - Achieved an accuracy of 0.98
